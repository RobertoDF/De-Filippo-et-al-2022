abstract = "Hippocampal ripples are highly synchronous neural events critical for memory consolidation and retrieval. " \
           "A minority of strong ripples has been shown to be of particular importance in situations of increased memory demands. " \
           "The propagation dynamics of strong ripples inside the hippocampal formation are, however, still opaque and " \
           "it remains an open question whether their propagation differ from common ripples." \
           f"We analyzed ripple propagation within the septal half of the hippocampal formation in an open access dataset" \
           f" provided by the Allen Institute. " \
           "Surprisingly, strong ripples propagate differentially in the septal and temporal direction " \
           "along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. " \
           "The septal hippocampal pole is able to generate" \
           " longer ripples that engage more neurons" \
           " and elicit spiking activity for an extended time along the entire septal half of the hippocampal formation. Ripples generated septally " \
           "have therefore higher chances of retaining their strength while travelling within the hippocampus. " \
           f"A substantial portion of the variance in strong ripple duration (RÂ² = {r_strong}) is explained solely by the ripple generation " \
           f"point on the longitudinal axis. " \
           "Our results suggest a possible distinctive role of the hippocampal septal pole in conditions of high memory demand. "
