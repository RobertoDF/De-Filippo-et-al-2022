             "longitudinal axis. This propagation idiosyncrasy can be explained by a specific ability of the hippocampal septal (medial) pole to produce longer " \
             "strong ripples that better entrain the hippocampal network and spread across the longitudinal axis. " \
             "It was previously observed that ripples located at the septal and temporal pole are generated indipendently from each other, " \
             "in addition, despite the presence of connections within the hippocampal longitudinal axis {Witter, 2007 #1155; van Strien, 2009 #1156}, " \
             "in the vast majority of cases they do not propagate to the opposite pole {Sosa, 2020 #1154}. "\
             "In accordance with these results, " \
             "we observed a strong effect of spatial distance on ripple power correlation confirming a previous study {Nitzan, 2022 #1157}: " \
             "the power correlation, predictably, was higher in CA1 pairs" \
             "closer to each other. The effect of distance was also apparent on the ripple chance of propagation, only half of the ripples generated in " \
             "the septal pole were detected simultaneously in the intermediate hippocampus. This chance is much higher compared to the one reported between " \
             "opposite poles (~3.7%), it would be interesting to understand whether the temporal pole is also able to entrain the intermediate hippocampus" \
             "in similar fashion or it is a peculiarity of the septal pole. \n" \
             "Ripples can arise at any location along the hippocampal longitudinal axis {Patel, 2013 #1133}, our analysis shows that ripples are, however, " \
             "not homogeneously generated across space. We observed differences between strong ripples and common ripples generation. Notably, the dataset we " \
             "employed is limited to the septal and intermediate hippocampus. Common ripples  " \
             "generation followed a gradient with higher likelihood in the intermediate section and lowest in the septal pole." \
             "Strong ripples, on the other hand, are mostly generated locally and only rarely in the intermediate section." \
             "Long duration ripples has been shown to be of particular importance in situations of " \
             "high-memory demand {Fern√°ndez-Ruiz, 2019 #1121}, these results suggest a possible distinctive role of the hippocampal" \
             " septal pole in these situations. This is consistent with previous studies that highlighted " \
             "the role of the septal hippocampus in memory tasks and information processing {Hock, 1998 #1122;Moser, 1993 #1123;Moser, 1995 #1124;Steffenach, 2005 #1128;" \
