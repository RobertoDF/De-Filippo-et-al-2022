introduction= "Hippocampal ripples are brief oscillatory events detected in the local field potential (LFP) of the hippocampal formation," \
              " these events correspond to the synchronized depolarization of a substantial number of neurons in various" \
              " hippocampal subregions {Hulse, 2016 #1141; Ylinen, 1995 #1140}. " \
              "An higher ripple incidence during memory encoding is associated with superior recall performance {Norman, 2019 #1142}, " \
              " furthermore, ripple incidence is increased during successful memory retrieval {Vaz, 2019 #1147; Carr, 2011 #1169}. " \
              "Ripples are also involved in memory consolidation both in awake and sleep conditions {Jadhav, 2012 #1143; Roux, 2017 #1144; " \
              "Sirota, 2003 #1145; Girardeau, 2009 #1146}, " \
              "disrupting awake ripples during learning causes a persisting performance degradation, the same effect can be achieved by " \
              "silencing ripples during post-learning sleep. " \
              "Accordingly, ripples are considered to play a crucial role in memory processes and reorganization of memory engrams " \
              "{Girardeau, 2011 #1148; Buzsáki, 2015 #1110;Diba, 2007 #1111;" \
              "Foster, 2006 #1112; Xu, 2019 #1113;Takahashi, 2015 #1114;Davidson, 2009 #1116; Pfeiffer, 2015 #1117;" \
              "Dragoi, 2011 #1118; Girardeau, 2009 #1120}. " \
              "Ripples duration exhibits a skewed distribution with only a minority of long-duration ripples (>100 ms). " \
              "Interestingly, the fraction of long-duration ripples " \
              "is increased in novel contexts, in memory-demanding tasks and during correct recalls {Fernández-Ruiz, 2019 #1121}. " \
              "Reducing ripple duration artificially causes a degraded working memory performance {Jadhav, 2012 #1135} and, on the contrary, " \
              "prolongation has a beneficial effect {Fernández-Ruiz, 2019 #1121}. " \
              "Ripple duration is directly proportional to ripple amplitude {Patel, 2013 #1133}, therefore, " \
              "these results point at a specific role " \
              "of stronger ripples in situations of high mnemonic demand and are consistent with a possible " \
              "power law distribution where a minority of ripples" \
              " is responsible for a substantial part of memory requirements. " \
              "For this reason, it is of interest to identify the possible electrophysiological peculiarities of this subgroup of ripples. Do strong ripples propagate differently " \
              "compared to common ripples? Are strong ripples generated homogeneously along the hippocampal longitudinal axis? Do ripples have a preferred longitudinal " \
              "directionality? " \
              "In this study we focused our attention on ripples generation and propagation within the hippocampal formation. " \
              "Hippocampal connectivity with cortical and sub-cortical areas varies considerably " \
              "along the longitudinal axis {Moser, 1998 #1149; Fanselow, 2010 #1150} and gene expression, as well, exhibits both gradual and discrete " \
              "transitions along the same axis {Vogel, 2020 #1151; Strange, 2014 #1158}. Consequently, the hippocampus is considered to be functionally segmented " \
              "along its long axis. " \
              "The different connectivity contributes " \
              "to explain the functional organization gradient between a predominantly spatio-visual (septal pole) and emotional (temporal pole) processing. " \
              "Ripples generated in the septal and temporal hippocampal pole has already been shown to be temporally independent and able to engage " \
              "different neuron subpopulations, even in the same downstream brain area {Sosa, 2020 #1154}. Consequentially, a heterogeneous " \
              "ripple generation chance along the longitudinal axis " \
              "most probably has an impact on the frequency with which different brain areas and neurons subgroups are activated. " \
              "Our work is based on a dataset provided by the Allen Institute {Siegle, 2021 #1127}, this dataset enabled us to study" \
              " comprehensively ripples features " \
              "across the septal half of the hippocampus. Previous studies have looked at ripple propagation along the longitudinal " \
              "axes of the hippocampus {Patel, 2013 #1133; Kumar, 2020 #1153}" \
              ", however, the size of this dataset made it possible to unveil propagation details previously overlooked."\
