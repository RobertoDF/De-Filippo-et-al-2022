introduction= "Hippocampal ripples are brief oscillatory events detected in the local field potential (LFP) of the hippocampal formation," \
              " these events corresponds to the synchronized depolarization of a substantial number of neurons in various" \
              " hippocampal subregions {Hulse, 2016 #1141; Ylinen, 1995 #1140}. " \
              "An higher ripple incidence during memory encoding is associated with superior recall performance {Norman, 2019 #1142}, " \
              " furthermore, ripple incidence is increased during successful memory retrieval {Vaz, 2019 #1147}." \
              "Ripples are also important for memory consolidation both in awake and sleep conditions {Jadhav, 2012 #1143; Roux, 2017 #1144; Sirota, 2003 #1145; Girardeau, 2009 #1146}," \
             "Accordingly, ripples are considered to play a crucial role in memory processes and reorganization of memory engrams {Girardeau, 2011 #1148; Buzsáki, 2015 #1110;Diba, 2007 #1111;" \
             "Foster, 2006 #1112;Xu, 2019 #1113;Takahashi, 2015 #1114;Davidson, 2009 #1116;Pfeiffer, 2015 #1117;" \
             "Dragoi, 2011 #1118;Girardeau, 2009 #1120}. " \
              "Ripples duration follows a skewed distribution with a minority of long-duration ripples, interestingly, the fraction of long-duration ripples " \
              "is increased in novel contexts, in tasks requiring memory and during correct recalls {Fernández-Ruiz, 2019 #1121}. These reults point at a specific role " \
              "of long-duration ripples in situations of high mnemonic demand" \
             " Reducing ripple duration artificially causes degraded working memory performance {Jadhav, 2012 #1135}, on the contrary, " \
             "prolongation has a beneficial effect {Fernández-Ruiz, 2019 #1121}. These results are consistent with a possible " \
             "power law distribution of ripples where a minority of stronger ripples is responsible for a substantial part of memory requirements. " \
             "Indeed, ripple duration is directly proportional to ripple amplitude {Patel, 2013 #1133}. "\
             "It is therefore of interest to identify the possible electro-physiological peculiarities of this sub-class of ripples. " \
              "We focused our attention on propagation within the hippocampal formation. Connectivity with cortical and sub-cortical areas varies  " \
              "along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus {Moser, 1998 #1149; Vogel, 2020 #1151; Fanselow, 2010 #1150}, the different connectivity contributes " \
              "to explain the functional organization gradient between a predominantly spatio-visual (septal pole) or emotional (temporal pole) processing." \
             "The dataset provided by the Allen Institute {Siegle, 2021 #1127} enabled us to study comprehensively ripples features " \
              "across the dorsal half of the hippocampus. The size of this dataset made it possible to unveil propagation details that could have been missed " \
              "in previous studies."\
